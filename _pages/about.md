<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an undergraduate student at Rice University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
My research focuses on advancing AI solutions for **social applications within language and vision domains**. Specifically, I have worked in the following areas:

- Improving language models' conversational and reasoning abilities in complex and specialized social context.
- Analyzing and mitigating vision models' biases in visual feature representations.

During my undergraduate studies at Rice University, I am advised by [Dr. Richard Baraniuk](https://richb.rice.edu/) and [Dr. Guha Balakrishnan](https://www.guhabalakrishnan.com/).

In the past, I worked with [Dr. Reid Simmons](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~reids/) at Carnegie Mellon University on human-robot interaction and [Dr. Joseph Young](https://jy46.github.io/) at Rice University on person re-identification and localization.
