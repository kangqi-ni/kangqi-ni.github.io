<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an undergraduate student at Rice University majoring in Computer Science and Math. My research interests span both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). Specifically, I am interested in the following areas:

- **Language Model Alignment**: Enhancing the reasoning and conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through text mining and alignment.
- **NLP Applications in Education**: Leveraging language models to develop intelligenet tutoring systems that enable personalized and improved educationl experiences.
- **Feature Learning**: Understanding biases of image and text feature representations and exploring methods to learn effective feature representations.

I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Richard Baraniuk on language model alignment and its applications, as well as by Dr. Guha Balakrishnan on feature learning in CV.

In the past, I collaborated with Dr. Reid Simmons at Carnegie Mellon University on adaptive human-robot interaction. Prior to that, I worked with Dr. Joseph Young at Rice University on person re-identification and localization.
