<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an undergraduate student at Rice University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My research interests are advancing language and vision systems for social applications. Specifically, I have worked in the following areas:

- **Human-Centric Language Models**: Developing specialized language models that serve as intelligent agents, tailored to address specific social needs.
- **Responsible and Reliable Vision Models**: Analyzing and mitigating biases in vision models to achieve equitable and robust feature representations.

I am advised by [Dr. Richard Baraniuk](https://richb.rice.edu/) on human-centric language models, as well as by [Dr. Guha Balakrishnan](https://www.guhabalakrishnan.com/) on responsible and reliable vision models.

In the past, I worked with [Dr. Reid Simmons](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~reids/) at Carnegie Mellon University on adaptive human-robot interaction. Prior to that, I worked on person re-identification and localization with [Dr. Joseph Young](https://jy46.github.io/) at Rice University.
