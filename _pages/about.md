<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an undergraduate student at Rice University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My research interests span both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). Specifically, I am interested in the following areas:

- **Domain-Specific Language Models**: Developing cost-effective, specialized language models that serve as personalized, intelligent agents tailored to the needs of different communities.
- **Responsible and Reliable Vision Models**: Analyzing and mitigating biases in vision models to achieve equitable and robust feature representations.

I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Richard Baraniuk on developing domain-specific language models, as well as by Dr. Guha Balakrishnan on advancing responsible and reliable vision models.

In the past, I worked with Dr. Reid Simmons at Carnegie Mellon University on adaptive human-robot interaction. Prior to that, I worked on person re-identification and localization with Dr. Joseph Young at Rice University.

<!-- - **Language Model Alignment**: Enhancing the reasoning and conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through fine-tuning and feedback learning. -->
<!-- - **NLP in Education**: Leveraging language models to develop intelligenet tutoring systems that enable personalized and improved educationl experiences. -->
